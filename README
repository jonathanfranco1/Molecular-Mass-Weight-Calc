A C++ program to convert chemical formulas into molar masses.

Included Files:
- molarMass.cpp: the program that calculates the molar mass
- mapGen.cpp: a helpful tool to add new elements to molarMass.cpp

How to use calculator:
1. Compile the molarMass.cpp on your favorite compiler.
2. Run the compiled program like ./molarMass NH3.
    - this returns "Molar mass: 17.034"

How to use mass map generator:
1. Compile mapGen.cpp.
2. Run the executable and type in the elements and molar masses.
3. Type done when finished.
4. Copy the resulting text and paste into molarMass.cpp.
